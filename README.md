An inventory management system for electronic devices complete with a login, registration, database and laravel framework. Inventory management should include the ability to input device type, name, brand, quantity, serial number and phone number and if it's in stock or deployed and if deployed - person's name. Also there should be an easy way to monitor available devices and the whole application has to push and contain all the data in some kind of database
